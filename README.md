# Unicode XOR Encryption Script
This Python script performs Unicode XOR encryption on a given input string. It takes each character of the input string, converts it into Unicode, converts the Unicode values into binary representations, performs an XOR operation with a specified key, and then converts the resulting binary back into characters.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/William2716057/XORscript.git
```
1. Navigate to the repository directory:
2. Run the script with Python:
