A simple python script that performs an XOR encryption on a given string

The input word is first converted to unicode then to binary representation

The XOR operation is performed using the defined number of 13 on each bit of the binary notation 

The XORed result is then converted to decimals and then to characters

The final result is the XOR encrypted string
